# Coordination

Session: `ef111e02` (final integration session). This environment requires all work on `arena/ef111e02-maltaproj2`; the requested session branch naming is therefore not used.

## Log
- Initial checkout contains only README.md (`# MaltaProj2`), no application, data, tests, or existing task board. No other task claims exist.
- Official source verification is mandatory. Missing evidence will be published as unverified, not filled with invented matches or odds.

### Source investigation and implementation (2026-10-13)
- Initial branch did not exist remotely: first `pull --rebase origin arena/ef111e02-maltaproj2` failed. Rebased against main for initial claim publication, then pushed only the session branch. No concurrent claims or merge conflicts found.
- Public lobby inspected via fetch_page, all three chunks: 26 cards, counters 60 / 86. Later hosted-runner HTTP response contains 86 embedded fixtures and 27 cards; snapshots are retained separately, never represented as simultaneous.
- Reverse engineering: public Angular `script#ng-state` includes the `/api/v1/fixtures` response and permalink map. Read these from public HTML only; no admin API request or authentication bypass. Explicit epoch timestamps permit UTC conversion without guessing display timezone.
- Sources: https://play.hotspawn.com/lobby ; https://play.hotspawn.com/how-it-works ; https://www.hotspawn.com/matches/astralis-vs-sashi-stake-pulse-beat-iii-1079438 ; https://www.hltv.org/betting/analytics ; https://thunderpick.io/esports/cs2-betting/thunderpick-world-championship-2026/11024/9z-team-vs-aurora/2796376 ; https://thunderpick.io/esports/cs2-betting/pulse-beat-iii/11173/astralis-vs-sashi/2767822 .
- Official bookmaker market extracts give +280 / -455 and -1250 / +530 respectively. Only dated reference calculations are published; no current fixture probabilities are populated. Provider quote time, timezone, live/pre-match state and exact source identity joins are not verified.
- Hosted runner can retrieve lobby (HTTP 200, Age 3839), while Thunderpick returns 403 challenge. No bypass attempted. Probe headers sanitized to remove Set-Cookie; public HTML stored as inert text. Automatic current odds ingestion remains incomplete and needs review.
- Existing README reviewed line by line: only project name; no factual data to validate. New source-data pipeline is separate from the probability arithmetic; crowd-picked percentages never enter normalized fixtures or model inputs.
- Verification: 7 unittest cases pass locally: real captured parser fixture, exact UTC conversion, 86 records / 27 cards, rejected schema changes, invalid odds, probability normalization, blank current probabilities, every table row has an official source link, all local links/anchors exist. External-link reachability is not universally certified.
- Irregularities published on `docs/flags.html`: cached content, incomplete global/game coverage, historical scheduled entries, differing lock offsets, bookmaker access block, reference-quote identity/freshness ambiguity, schedule display differences.
