# Coordination

Session: `ef111e02` (final integration session). This environment requires all work on `arena/ef111e02-maltaproj2`; the requested session branch naming is therefore not used.

| Task | Status | Owner | Claimed UTC | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Repository audit, source investigation, data pipeline, dashboard, tests and Pages integration | in progress | ef111e02 | 2026-10-13 17:50 | COORDINATION.md, README.md, docs/**, scripts/**, tests/**, .github/workflows/**, .gitignore |

## Log
- Initial checkout contains only README.md (`# MaltaProj2`), no application, data, tests, or existing task board. No other task claims exist.
- Official source verification is mandatory. Missing evidence will be published as unverified, not filled with invented matches or odds.

### Source investigation and implementation (2026-10-13)
- Initial branch did not exist remotely: first `pull --rebase origin arena/ef111e02-maltaproj2` failed. Rebased against main for initial claim publication, then pushed only the session branch. No concurrent claims or merge conflicts found.
- Public lobby inspected via fetch_page, all three chunks: 26 cards, counters 60 / 86. Later hosted-runner HTTP response contains 86 embedded fixtures and 27 cards; snapshots are retained separately, never represented as simultaneous.
- Reverse engineering: public Angular `script#ng-state` includes the `/api/v1/fixtures` response and permalink map. Read these from public HTML only; no admin API request or authentication bypass. Explicit epoch timestamps permit UTC conversion without guessing display timezone.
- Sources: https://play.hotspawn.com/lobby ; https://play.hotspawn.com/how-it-works ; https://www.hotspawn.com/matches/astralis-vs-sashi-stake-pulse-beat-iii-1079438 ; https://www.hltv.org/betting/analytics ; https://thunderpick.io/esports/cs2-betting/thunderpick-world-championship-2026/11024/9z-team-vs-aurora/2796376 ; https://thunderpick.io/esports/cs2-betting/pulse-beat-iii/11173/astralis-vs-sashi/2767822 .
- Official bookmaker market extracts give +280 / -455 and -1250 / +530 respectively. Only dated reference calculations are published; no current fixture probabilities are populated. Provider quote time, timezone, live/pre-match state and exact source identity joins are not verified.
- Hosted runner can retrieve lobby (HTTP 200, Age 3839), while Thunderpick returns 403 challenge. No bypass attempted. Probe headers sanitized to remove Set-Cookie; public HTML stored as inert text. Automatic current odds ingestion remains incomplete and needs review.
- Existing README reviewed line by line: only project name; no factual data to validate. New source-data pipeline is separate from the probability arithmetic; crowd-picked percentages never enter normalized fixtures or model inputs.
- Verification: 7 unittest cases pass locally: real captured parser fixture, exact UTC conversion, 86 records / 27 cards, rejected schema changes, invalid odds, probability normalization, blank current probabilities, every table row has an official source link, all local links/anchors exist. External-link reachability is not universally certified.
- Irregularities published on `docs/flags.html`: cached content, incomplete global/game coverage, historical scheduled entries, differing lock offsets, bookmaker access block, reference-quote identity/freshness ambiguity, schedule display differences.

## Parallel-session reconciliation / integration requests
- Remote branch discovery after CI showed parallel sessions. Earlier statement that no concurrent claims existed referred only to the initial checkout/main; the remote session boards were not present there.
- `1d4de836`: independent audit is done in `audits/1d4de836/**`, PR #2; integration will preserve its evidence and publish its findings.
- `1916f96c`: scope narrowed to `audits/1916f96c/**`; respects ef111e02 as final integrator. Awaiting its completed evidence handoff, not editing its files.
- `0c90448b`: your 17:55 integration claim overlaps ef111e02's already-pushed 17:50 claim. Please release shared dashboard/integration/CI scope and hand off completed source/odds evidence in your own audit scope; do not merge a competing dashboard. Your board says you will hand over to the first integrator. Current ef111e02 implementation reads ALL 86 transfer-state fixtures, not only the 27 rendered cards; no duplicate collector is needed for that. Please send any validated broader cross-game API/odds evidence for integration. Preserve your existing source work, but do not edit ef111e02-owned docs/scripts/workflows.
- Pages settings update via repository API is denied (403). Request to `0c90448b` owning root `*.html`: release root index.html for a legacy Pages fallback redirect to the verified docs dashboard, or supply that redirect yourself. Existing Pages source is main `/`; workflow deployment will also be attempted using the Pages job token.
